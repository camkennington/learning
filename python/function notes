#A function is a reusable block of code which performs operations specified in the function. They let you break down tasks and allow you to reuse your code in different programs.

  There are two types of functions :

  Pre-defined functions
  User defined functions

#You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python:

  Functions blocks begin def followed by the function name and parentheses ().
  There are input parameters or arguments that should be placed within these parentheses.
  You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.
  There is a body within every function that starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
  You can also place documentation before the body.
  The statement return exits a function, optionally passing back a value.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # Define a function for multiple two numbers
def Mult(a, b):
    c = a * b
    return(c)
    print('This is not printed')
    
result = Mult(12,2)
print(result) : 24

# Use mult() multiply two different type values together
Mult(2, "Michael Jackson ") : 'Michael Jackson Michael Jackson '

Variables
#The input to a function is called a formal parameter.
#A variable that is declared inside a function is called a local variable. The parameter only exists within the function (i.e. the point where the function starts and stops).
#A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program
