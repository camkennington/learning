# check python version
  #sys is a built-in module that contains many system-specific parameters and functions, including the Python version in use. Before using it, we must explictly import it.

import sys
print(sys.version)



# Print the element on the 13th index in the string
  #Because indexing starts at 0, it means the first index is on the index 0.

print(name[13])

Stride

# Get every second element in the range from index 0 to index 4
name[0:5:2]
