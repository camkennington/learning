# check python version
  #sys is a built-in module that contains many system-specific parameters and functions, including the Python version in use. Before using it, we must explictly import it.

import sys
print(sys.version)



# Print the element on the 13th index in the string
  #Because indexing starts at 0, it means the first index is on the index 0.

print(name[13])



Stride

# Get every second element in the range from index 0 to index 4
name[0:5:2]


Escape Sequence
# New line escape sequence
print(" Michael Jackson \n is the best" )

# Tab escape sequence
print(" Michael Jackson \t is the best" )

# Include back slash in string
print(" Michael Jackson \\ is the best" ) = Michael Jackson \ is the best


# r will tell python that string will be display as raw string
print(r" Michael Jackson \ is the best" )



# Replace the old substring with the new target substring is the segment has been found in the string
a = "Michael Jackson is the best"
b = a.replace('Michael', 'Janet')
b


# Find the substring in the string. Only the index of the first elment of substring in string will be the output
name = "Michael Jackson"
name.find('el')

print(r"\ ")

#Convert the variable f to uppercase:
print(f.upper())
